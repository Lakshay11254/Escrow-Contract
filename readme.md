This is an Escrow Dapp built with [Hardhat].

## Project Layout

---Run these commands on terminal on the specific directories---

cd ./app = npm install 
cd ./backend = npm install
cd ./app = npm start 



<!-- ## Setup

Install dependencies in the top-level directory with `npm install`.

After you have installed hardhat locally, you can use commands to test and compile the contracts, among other things. To learn more about these commands run `npx hardhat help`.

Compile the contracts using `npx hardhat compile`. The artifacts will be placed in the `backend` folder, which will make it available to the front-end. This path configuration can be found in the `hardhat.config.js` file.
